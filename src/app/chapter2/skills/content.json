      "The worlds beyond the Waygate can be wild, untamed places. They are not places for the faint of heart or the ill-prepared. As such, everyone who journeys beyond should be given some amount of training to give them a chance at survival",
      "Some skills are feats of great strength, endurance, and acrobatics. Others of keen insight and knowledge. All will be helpful on your quest.",
      "In some worlds, however, where Waygates have existed for centuries, there exists a power sourced from the very void between this world and the ethereal plane from which the gates originated. As the void seeped out into those worlds, its influence slowly spread across those worlds, shaping the essence of all living things it came into contact with. When this happens, if the world itself isn't torn asunder, the beings there may find (through luck or study) they have the ability to tap into that void, and from it draw great magical power. Practitioners, after some training, are able to shape these energies into forms useful both in and out of combat.... if they are clever enough."
