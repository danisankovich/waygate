    Preface:
  </h1>
  <p>Welcome to Enter the Waygate. While this book and the rules therein are
    meant to help and guide you, always remember that the GM has the final word
    and that a fun story should always come before any rule or guideline you find
    in these texts. Have fun with it. Justify why a character with no strength
    should be allowed to wear full plate armor. Explain away any apparent
    inconsistencies with your skillset. Create a few spells and skills that
    are more wacky than pragmatic. It’s all in the name of immersing yourself
    in a story unique to your group. </p>
    <p>Several aspects of this game are already optional (such as distance and
      size modifiers, but we’ll get to those later). There’s no reason why you
      can’t make other sections optional as well.</p>
