  "intro": "Weapons come in two types: Basic and Advanced. Gaining a proficiency in a basic weapon is rather simple, through a bit of practice or by acquiring it through a skill purchase. Gaining proficiency in advanced weaponry, however, takes much more time and training, but they tend to be more powerful and useful across various circumstances. Using a weapon that you are not proficient with gives a -2 to all hit tests made with that weapon.",
