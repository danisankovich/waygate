    "Those who venture into the dangerous, and often unexplored, worlds beyond the Waygates, are likely to find themselves engaged in combat from time to time. From bandits, to vast armies, to wild beasts, to the warped creatures from the spaces between dimensions, adventurers must be able to defend themselves against all threats if they hope to live long enough to see their mission to completion.",
    "Combat is initiated when an attack is launched, be it an ambush, two armies meeting on the battlefield, or simply opposing forces running into each other at an inopportune moment. Depending on how combat is initiated, characters may receive unique penalties or bonuses. In combat a turn is 2 actions (roughly 6 seconds). A round is a full rotation through the list of active characters."

  "info": [
    "Oftentimes you will have no choice but to engage in combat. If you're ambushed or if a hostile force wishes to attack you and you are unable to talk your way out of the situation, weapons will have to be drawn.",
    "Other times, you may be the one to initiate combat. To do this, simply make your preparations and declare your intentions to fight to the DM. Make sure to tell them how you wish to approach the situation (ex. are you stealthed? Who are you approaching? Is your weapon drawn?)"
