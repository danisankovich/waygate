<p>Welcome to Enter the Waygate. While this book and the rules therein are meant to help and guide you, always remember that the GM has the final word and that a fun story should always come before any rule or guideline you find in these texts. Have fun with it. Justify why a character with no strength should be allowed to wear full plate armor. Explain away any apparent inconsistencies with your skillset. Create a few spells and skills that are more wacky than pragmatic. Itâ€™s all in the name of immersing yourself in a story unique to your group. </p>
