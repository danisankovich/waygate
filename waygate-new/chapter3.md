"Bastard sword, check. Black powder, check. Six knives, a bow, a couple of whet stones, medpacs, and a data slate. Traveling light as usual." -- Sven, Form Occupation Unknown

**Note**: Do not feel tied down to the information in this chapter. Think of this as merely a guide to creating your own world. You may find that you need to make minor adjustments here and there to make the items fit to your setting. The tables in this chapter are not exhaustive lists, and the details of each item can be changed to suit your world and needs.
While most technology and weapons available to you will be from Earth, a couple of years of exploration into the Waygates have introduced Earth to a world of technological marvels. While there is no guarantee that the world you will travel to will have advanced technology of its own, that does not mean that other adventurers haven’t sold items of worth in this new world, or that officials haven’t set up shop beyond the Waygate. You may even be surprised by what is available in the most savage of worlds.

When looking to buy items, these charts should only be used as guides, not as fact. Different shops will have varying stock and prices depending on item rarity, world availability, culture, etc.

If you wish to search an area for items to purchase, as the GM to do a knowledge check of the area. Roll a d20 and add your Int stat to the roll. Based on your result, you may find rarer or poorer quality items

You may have to do some hunting to find what you seek.
