<div style="text-align: center;"><ins><h1>Chapter 7: Magic</h1></ins></div>

"Magic is a fickle thing. Use it poorly, things go wrong. Use it without conviction, things go wrong. Use it just right, somehow things might still go wrong." -- Tanya Tokevic, Anthropologist

<div style="text-align: center;"><ins><h2>Background</h2></ins></div>

Magic is a mysterious force, one that is not yet fully understood. While all beings have magical potential, the use of magic appears to be reliant on the existence of a magical connection in the user’s world, more so than any innate aptitude. Even the most powerful of magical practitioners will find themselves powerless in a world where the threads of magic are disconnected from the Aether.

But even in the most magically inclined worlds, the exact nature of this force remains unknown, as the greatest minds study tirelessly to make any breakthrough. As such, magic remains a dangerous and risky force to use, but for many the potential benefits far outweigh such risks as users find themselves tapping into power that they had only ever dreamed of.

<div style="text-align: center;"><ins><h2>Learning</h2></ins></div>

In order to tap into one’s magical aptitude, they first must learn the basics. This isn’t something that one can learn simply through basic study or from a magical tome. You must first seek someone out who is willing to teach you to use this force (the Magical Affinity skill), as only they have the knowledge to fully open up the channels that will allow the threads of magic flow through you.

Once learned, new magical abilities can be accrued through leveling up, progression of story, and feats of strength.

<div style="text-align: center;"><ins><h2>Magical Mayhem</h2></ins></div>

Magical Skills provide a lot of power and versatility, but they are not without their drawbacks. Magic is a fickle thing, and the magical threads that bind the world together are only meant to be stretched so far.

When a magician overuse their connection to these magical threads, they run the risk of tearing these threads apart momentarily, causing Magical Mayhem. When this happens, strange energies leak in the world from the Aether before the magical seams of the universe can repair themselves. The effects of this leakage range from mild inconvenience to life-threatening dangers.

<div style="text-align: center;"><ins><h4>Causing Magical Mayhem</h4></ins></div>

  * Failing with magic to a very high degree
    * When the final result of a Mystic Test for any spell is less than half the spell’s required Mystic Test value (rounded down).
    * Rolling a critical fail when using a magic skill.
  * Using two spells in one turn
    * Sustaining a spell does not count towards this
  * Using three of the four actions you have over two turns on spells (ex. One Action one turn, Two Actions next turn)
  * In one round, if 10 actions are spent using magic by any number of characters (DM should keep track with a d10).
Typically, Magical Mayhem cannot be stopped. Legends speak of powerful magicians halting the process, but officially there are no reports of this ever happening.

**Magical Mayhem**: Aether Marks cannot be used to change your roll.
