"You'll want to come home every day. You'll yearn for your soft beds and the safety of your home. But the moment you get there, you'll find you crave the ability to touch the power you once could." -- Arthur Penrose, Archaeologist

The worlds beyond the Waygate can be wild, untamed places. They are not places for the faint of heart or the ill-prepared. As such, everyone who journeys beyond should be given some amount of training to give them a chance at survival

Some skills are feats of great strength, endurance, and acrobatics. Others of keen insight and knowledge. All will be helpful on your quest.

In some worlds, however, where Waygates have existed for centuries, there exists a power sourced from the very Aether between this world and the ethereal plane from which the gates originated. As the Aether seeped out into those worlds, its influence slowly spread across those worlds, shaping the essence of all living things it came into contact with. When this happens, if the world itself isn't torn asunder, the beings there may find (through luck or study) they have the ability to tap into the Aether, and from it draw great magical power. Practitioners, after some training, are able to shape these energies into forms useful both in and out of combat.... if they are clever enough.

"It was hard at first. I could hardly swing a sword and couldn't reload a pistol without dropping the clip. But in that world it was either learn or die. It just took a bit of motivation." -- Hannah Holtmeier, Horticulturist

Skills are special attributes or actions that your character can take both in and out of combat. All skills are learnable by all players, with the exception of Special Skills which are only ever gifted or inflicted upon characters due to specific events that take place within gameplay.

Skills that can be used in combat are marked with either "One Action" or "Two Actions." A turn is made up of Two Actions. For more information on Combat see **Chapter 6: Combat**.

Skills come in one of three varieties: Physical, Knowledge, and Magic, and are earned through several means, listed later in this chapter.

Physical Skills are learned through vigorous training and self-discipline. Skills such as special attacks, weapon specializations, acrobatics, and actions of physical exertion typically fall into the Physical Skills category.

Skills such as literacy, tech use, maintenance, crafting typically fall into the Knowledge category.

Skills such as spells, magical augmentation, and magic resistances typically fall into the Magic category.

However, not all skills are so easily placed within one of these three categories and can easily be considered hybrids.

Some skills (listed as **Trainable** in the skill list) can be trained to further increase their effectiveness. In this event, these skills can be used by any character, even when untrained, but have varying bonuses and penalties attached depending on the level of training. A skill that can be upgraded will have requirement for all upgrades listed.

##### The modifiers for each level taken in a trainable skill areas follows.
  * Untrained (never purchased or learned): -2
  * Basic: +0
  * Learned: +1
  * Skilled: +2
  * Master: +3

<div style="text-align: center;"><ins><h4>Terminology</h4></ins></div>

**Prerequisites**: Some skills have prerequisites you must fulfill before they can be acquired. However, these can be ignored (under rare circumstances) if the skill is learned through gameplay, which is detailed later in this chapter.

**Mystic Test**: Some skills (typically magic) have a **Mystic Test** that must be passed. You must reach or exceed this value on a dice roll (with modifiers) for the skill to be successfully used. Mystic Test details are listed within the skill and should be written down on your character sheet once you purchase the skill. Mystic Test roles are rolled with 1d20 and use the listed attribute as a modifier (if none are mentioned, Magic is used). If it is a Magical Skill (MS) and the result (1d20 + modifier) of a Mystic Test test for any spell is less than half the spell’s Mystic Test (rounded down), Magical Mayhem occurs.

**Requirements**: Conditions that must be met to use the skill in a given situation. For example, weapons that can be used with particular skills, vision requirements, etc.

**Use**: How to use the spell and how to conduct the proper test.

###### Range: The distance at which a skill is effective
  * **Weapon**: whatever the range of the equipped weapon is
  * **Self**: The ability affects only the user
  * **Touch**: The user must touch who or whatever they are targetting
  * **Distance**: If numbers are given, that is the maximum (or minimum if listed) range at which the ability can be used

"After several months of grueling training, Aiden cast his first spell...... I simply woke up one day hovering a foot over my bed." -- Kerry Kerr, Magical Prodigy

#### Skill points are typically learned in one of five ways:
  * Leveling up by earning experience points
  * Performing mighty deeds that warrant a reward
  * Observation/study/someone teaching you
  * Practice
  * Aether Influence

Apart from Leveling Up, the awarding of Skill points is completely up to the GM’s discretion. Points earned in any way except for Leveling Up, must be used immediately.

#### Mighty Deeds
  * Sometimes an adventurer manages to overcome an obstacle that many believed was beyond their expertise. Maybe they took down a powerful foe with excellent precision. Maybe the cracked a code that many thought was un-crackable. Maybe they pushed their body or mind beyond their limits and came out on top. Whatever the reason, the actions they took showed true grit and determination, as well as a practiced hand.
  * If a Mighty Deed is performed while using a skill that can be leveled up, upgrade that skill to the next level, free of charge immediately.
  * A player who shows grace and skill in combat against a truly mighty foe or a horde of enemies may be granted a Physical Skill.
  * A player shows amazing magical prowess by besting another mage in magical combat, they may be granted a Magical Skill
  * A player who solves a challenging puzzle or riddle that left all others, including learned scholars, stumped may be granted a Knowledge Skill
  * Mighty deeds can be gifted to individuals or groups.
  * Mighty deeds are gifted at the DMs discretion

#### Observation/Study/Lessons
  * On their journey, an adventurer may find themselves in the presence of a wise teacher, who will be willing to teach them how to utilize a new skill. What they charge and how long it will take is up to them, as well as the character’s resolve (generally involves a quick lesson and/or quest).
  * Or maybe they will come across a sacred tome that describes the method by which they can learn a new skill or power.
  * Or, most difficult yet, when they are strong enough and wise enough to learn on the fly, they could learn the basics of a skill just by observation. Doing so typically requires a high intelligence, as well as an aptitude for learning quickly. Typically only allowed for players at a higher level, with high Awareness training.

#### Aether Influence
  * The Aether is a powerful, mysterious force. It's writhing, everflowing energies have the power to warp the very essence of living beings. Though most often direct exposure to the Aether leads one to misfortune, it has, on occassion, granted someone access to powers they did not hold before.
  * This is a very rare occurrence.

#### Practice
  * The most tried and true method. While unlikely to impart anyone with a new skill, practice can increase one’s skill.
  * Throughout your quest you may find yourself with free time, during which important events out of your control are taking place. Take the time to study, or go on side quests to improve your skills.

<div style="margin: auto; width: 66%;"><p><b>Note on upgrading Skills</b>: Not all skills have levels, however, there are a few skills that take logical steps. For example, if a player takes down powerful foes with repeated, successful use of a Firebolt, it makes sense that they may learn to use Fire Blast as a result. While whirlwind is not directly related to cleave, a GM may see fit to grant the whirlwind skill after several successful or impressive cleaves. As such, it is often better to reward the player with a specific skill or ability.</p><p>Keep in mind, there is no formula to this. Keep it as consistent as possible, and allow it to make logical sense through progression of the story and quest lines, but overall use it as a way to make the game interesting and keep it moving forward.</p></div>


<div style="text-align: center;"><ins><h2>Custom Skills</h2></ins></div>

"It's not all books and copying what others know. Sometimes you have to get creative." -- Alfonse Hamilton, Librarian

A player is allowed to create custom skills. They must supply the GM with all necessary details. The GM may approve or reject the proposal, or may make alterations. Players are encouraged to make custom skills that fit their character as the game progresses.
