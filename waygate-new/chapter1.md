"What is your goal here? To explore? To study? To conquer? That choice is yours to make. The worlds beyond the Waygates are filled with nothing, but potential. So tell me, what do you seek?" -- General Trask, Division of Waygate Research and Containment

In Waygate you take the role of a volunteer who recently signed up to venture through one of the many portals (Waygates) into other worlds and dimensions. Are you seeking to make money, or find fame, or perhaps run away from your old life? It doesn’t matter. Whoever you were before you enlisted is irrelevant to the task at hand. Your job is simply to go through the Waygate and bring back data on the world beyond.

The ends always justify the means, and no matter what you do beyond the Waygate in service of this task, your governing body will overlook your transgressions. But be warned. The world beyond may not be so tolerant of visitors, so proceed with your own ambitions at your own risk.

What's more, beyond the Waygates lie worlds with forces unheard of on earth. Tapping into these forces has the potential to grant one great power, but at a price. These energies are not well understood and are unstable at the best of times. So tread carefully, lest you find yourself doing something that can't be undone.

Your journey will not be easy. Few who venture through the Waygates are ever heard from again, and those who are rarely return unchanged, but the rewards, should you choose to go through with this task, will be beyond your wildest dreams.

<div style="text-align: center;"><ins><h2>Creating Your Character</h2></ins></div>

"I enlisted to escape the death penalty. I made a terrible mistake." -- Victor Olivera, US Enlistee, Group 023

The first thing you must do to begin your adventure is to make your Player Character. This is the character that you will represent and whose personality you will adopt throughout the game. As you continue through this chapter you will be walked through the process of character creation. There may be some terms that will be new to you, but no need to worry, all such terms will be explained throughout this book.

Before getting started, you will need to get a couple of dice. It is not necessary for everyone to have a collection of dice, so long as you have the following.

One four-sided dice (d4), one six-sided dice (d6), one eight-sided dice (d8), one 1 ten-sided dice (d10), one twelve-sided dice (d12), and one twenty-sided dice (d20). You will not need all of these dice for the purpose of character creation, but they will be required for normal gameplay. If you do not have physical dice, there are numerous free online dice rollers that you can make use of.

Note. Waygate does not utilize a traditional class or career system. Characters are typically seen as blank slates to grow as you wish, based on what you want to focus on. So do not worry about locking yourself out of certain skills, as every character has the potential to follow any build you see fit.

There are six steps you should follow when you create a new character. As you go through them, mark down the results of each step on your character sheet.

**Step One: Origin, Background, and Personality**: Everyone comes from somewhere, and your character is no exception. Maybe your character is an ex-school teacher from New Jersey. Maybe they are an app developer straight from the Silicon Valley. Maybe they were a criminal seeking to lighten their sentence by undergoing a journey through the Waygate. Wherever they were from and whatever they did beforehand will help define their personalities, priorities, and motivations.

**Step Two: Generate Attributes**: One very important aspect of your character is their attributes. These help determine your character’s success/fail ratios whenever they attempt to do something challenging or strenuous. For example, the Strength attribute helps determine if a character successfully moves something heavy out of the way, while the Intelligence attribute would help determine whether they succeed in solving a challenging puzzle.

**Step Three: Spend Initial Skill Points**: Everyone has skills. Skills are the abilities that your characters can attempt to utilize throughout the game and come in three categories: Phyiscal Skills, Knowledge Skills, and Magic Skills. To purchase these skills you must earn skill points.

**Step Four: Physical Description**: Detailing your character’s physical description will help immerse them into the world. Alongside the details from step one, this will help you determine how to play your character throughout the game.

**Step Five: Get Ready to Play**: Some final calculations and notes to make before the game starts.

**Step Six: Fate of the Waygate**: When the characters finally step into the Waygate, they undergo a process known as the Fate of the Waygate. Some leave unscathed, but most are not so fortunate.

Remember that while these steps provide a good guideline, the nature of the game allows for some variability. The GM will have final say in what steps are to be followed and how, but if no specifications are made, assume that you should follow everything on these lists.

<div style="text-align: center;"><ins><h2>Step One: Origin, Background, and Personality</h2></ins></div>

"Before going through the gate I was a timid accountant in Brooklyn. Yesterday I quelled a rebel uprising. Life’s never been better." -- Danica Bloom, Emperor’s Hand

Every country handles the Waygates differently. Some have decided that they should be closed off, and have done everything in their power to keep anyone from going in and everything from coming out of them. Others have decided to use them to their advantage: to research new technologies and the mystic arts, to learn more about the universe, to stumble upon great riches and resources.

Of those countries that send people beyond the Waygate, most put some sort of volunteer system in place. As such, it is rare to find two people of similar backgrounds in any group. Where you were born, where you live, and what you did before enlisting will help determine not only your character’s personality, but will also have some effect on their starting skills and attributes.

Your character can have any sort of background. Maybe they were in the military. Maybe they were a school teacher. A criminal seeking to commute their sentence. Maybe they were just bored and seeking adventure and riches. Anyone who goes beyond is promised two things in return for their work: an adventure like no other and whatever money and valuables they can find.

The following guide will walk you through the system for determining your character’s history and personality. Keep in mind, just because you know this information, it does not mean you have to divulge this information to anyone, but the GM. If it is within your character’s personality, feel free to keep this information secret.

Write down the results and answers to the following steps/questions on your character sheet.

1. What is your character’s name?
2. Mark down Level 1 in your Level section of your character sheet.
3. Where were you born, and where do you currently live?
  * You may include culture and religious background, if you so choose
4. Describe your character’s personality
  * What traits define your character
5. Why are you going into the Waygate?
  * Are you an adventurer? Are you running from something? Running toward something? Are you driven by a promise? Are you looking for something? Did you need money?
  * Whatever your reason, it is important that you know why your character is making the journey in the first place.

<div style="text-align: center;"><ins><h2>Step Two: Generate Attributes</h2></ins></div>

"I always thought I was just some dumb muscle. Turns out, I have quite a knack for tactics" -- Brick Broadstone, Fomer Body Builder

Attributes represent your characters aptitude in a multitude of physical and mental areas. All start at 0 (below average). A 2 in any stat represents an average human. A maximum value of 7 is considered above peak human condition. These attributes are important for numerous reasons. First and foremost, they represent your ability to succeed in a given task by providing benefits or detriments to your dice roll. Simply put, the higher the attribute, the better the bonus you receive towards successful rolls.

Keep in mind, attributes can go into the negative (hampered or challenged), and will provide detriments to rolls.

Several skills also have prerequisites based on Attribute values.

Attributes are generally increased in one of 3 ways.
1. **Leveling up**: when you level up, you gain a certain amount of attribute points to use, based on the level.
2. **Accomplishments**: Throughout the game, the GM is encouraged to grant increases to skills based on very impressive accomplishments.
3. **Random and Notable Events**: Throughout the game, you may run into situations that lead to a permanent increase or decrease in stats The GM should use such events sparingly.

<div style="text-align: center;"><ins><h4>Attributes</h4></ins></div>

**Strength (Str)**: How physically strong your character is. Affects your ability to perform physical abilities and how hard you are able to hit.

**Dexterity (Dex)**: How coordinated your character is. Affects your movement speed, ability to perform feats of precision, ability to act swiftly, and ability to avoid being hit.

**Vitality (Vit)**: How tough your character is. Affects your ability to maintain difficult tasks and stay strong under duress. Also affects overall health.

**Willpower (WP)**: How mentally resilient your character is. Affects your ability to shrug off mental and some magic attacks, and to keep going under emotional duress.

**Intelligence (Int)**: How smart/deductive your character is. Affects your ability to quickly and accurately deduce information and take in knowledge.

**Charisma (Cha)**: How charismatic/inherently likeable your character is. Affects your ability to sway others to your side, or to convince them to follow your line of thinking.

**Magic (mag)**: Your character’s proficiency and aptitude for magic. Determines damage done by magical abilities. This attribute cannot be improved or rolled on until the **Magical Affinity** skill is learned.

<div style="text-align: center;"><ins><h4>Determine Your Attribute Values</h4></ins></div>

1. All attributes start at 0.
2. You begin the game with 10 Attribute Points. You may allocate these  points however you wish amongst your attributes.
  * You cannot improve the Magic attribute until you have the **Magical Affinity** skill.
  * No stat can be above 3 at this point.
  * You may only have two stats (magic excluded) at 0 initially.
3. Determine your Health and mark this on your character sheet. Changes from damage should be made with pencil. Do not erase your total health value.
  * Health = 7 + 3x(Vitality) + (level x Constitution) (initial Constitution is 0)
4. Determine your armor rating: this is equal to 8 + dexterity + armor.
  * A hit test made against you succeeds if it reaches or surpasses this value.

<div style="text-align: center;"><ins><h2>Step Three: Spend Initial Skill Points</h2></ins></div>

"It’s amazing what you’ll learn after a few days in a Hell dimension. Did you know that the femur makes for a great club in a pinch?" -- Captain Kirsten Kelly, Wildlife Expert

In Enter the Waygate, there are no classes or careers that determine the abilities and powers you are able to learn. How you allocate your attribute points is the only determining factor in whether or not you can learn a specific skill. These skills in turn will help determine what role you best fulfill on a team.

**Knowledge Skills (KS)**: Skills that allow you to perform actions related to intelligence, insight, deduction, and information.

**Physical Skills (PS)**: Skills that allow you to perform intense or difficult physical acts, precise actions, or physical attacks.

**Magic Skills (MS)**: Skills that channel magic through the Aether to accomplish a task.
  * All Magic Skills require the Magical Affinity skill, which usually has to be learned from someone within the world of Waygate, and usually can only rarely be learned through self-study or leveling up.

Some skills have a leveling system, which influences how much of a bonus they grant when attempting to use them – Unlearned, Basic, Learned, Skilled, Masterful.
  * Skills can be levelled through purchases or through numerous successful/difficult uses.
  * Such skills can be used even when unlearned, though at penalty.

<div style="text-align: center;"><ins><h4>Starting Skills</h4></ins></div>

Take the following steps to gain your initial skills. Mark all skills earned in this chapter on your character sheet.

<div style="text-align: center;"><ins><h2>Step Four: Physical Description</h2></ins></div>

"They said the pointed ears could be fixed, but I have to say, they make a great conversation starter." -- Ika Melning, Former Raid Leader

Knowing and revealing what your character looks like is important for representing a core aspect of their characterization and will help your GM and players in interacting with them in the world of Waygate. It may also impact how NPCs in the world of Waygate act towards you.
  * What is your character’s age?
  * What is your character’s gender?
  * Physical description?
  * Other noteworthy Features?

<div style="text-align: center;"><ins><h2>Step Five: Next Steps</h2></ins></div>

<div style="text-align: center;"><ins><h2>Step Six: Fate of the Waygate</h2></ins></div>

"She was a grotesque thing, writhing about in endless pain. Her very existence a curse. She thanked me when I told her I'd put her out of her misery" -- Dana Row, Part-time Waitress/aspiring actress

When the characters finally step through the Waygate, they must undergo the Fate of the Waygate, during which the twisting nether of energies within the Waygate surge through the bodies of any who dares expose themselves. With energies of countless dimensions taking their toll, some are blessed with new skills or perspectives while some are left with defects and abnormalities. But whether or not the Waygate gives you heightened wisdom or cursed abilities, none who pass through the dimensions leave entirely unchanged.

All characters must roll a d100 against the Fate of the Waygate chart. These effects cannot be prevented or reversed through any known means (Including with Aether Marks).
