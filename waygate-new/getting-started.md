<div style="text-align: center;"><ins><h1>Preface</h1></ins></div>

"When the Waygates came everything changed. Everything we understood about the world was thrown to the wayside. Whole worlds were opened up to us; worlds beyond our wildest imagination lay before us, ripe for study, exploration, and the taking."-- General Parker Stone, First Leader of the Waygate Division, USA

Welcome to Enter the Waygate: a tabletop roleplaying game where the players play through an epic story, exploring intriguing locations, investigating grand discoveries, and encountering dangerous foes at almost every turn. Players will forge alliances and earn the ire of terrible enemies based on their actions as they try to complete their quest.

A game consists of a Game Master (GM) and any number of players, who each control a player character (PC). It is the GM's job to guide the players through a campaign (story), during which they will provide encounters, present challenges, and ensure that the players know how and when to properly roll for any given action that is needed.

While this book and the rules therein are meant to help and guide you, always remember that the GM has the final word and that a fun story should always come before any rule or guideline you find in these texts. Have fun with it. Justify why a character with no strength should be allowed to wear full plate armor. Explain away any apparent inconsistencies with your skillset. Create a few spells and skills that are more wacky than pragmatic. It’s all in the name of immersing yourself in a story unique to your group.

For players new to Enter the Waygate, skim through each chapter briefly and refer to the relevant sections as needed. A campaign can be as long or as short as desired. One-Shots are campaigns meant to be completed in one sitting session over a few minutes or hours. Most campaigns, however, span several sessions broken up at intervals.

In Enter the Waygate, the success and failure of actions are based on the results of two things: Dice and Roleplaying. How well you roll and how well you play your character through the story will determine whether or not things play out as you'd like, or if things go awry.

<div style="text-align: center;"><ins><h1>Dice</h1></ins></div>

The following dice are listed as dX, with X being the number of faces on the dice to roll. The higher the roll, the higher the chance of your action succeeding.

**d20** - A twenty-sided dice, with values ranging from 1-20. Primarily used for attribute tests and hit tests

**d12** - A twelve-sided dice, with values ranging from 1-12. Primarily used for damage rolls

**d10** - A ten-sided dice, with values ranging from 1-10. Primarily used for damage rolls

**d10p** - A ten-sided percentage dice, with values ranging from 1-10.

**d8** - An eight-sided dice, with values ranging from 1-8. Primarily used for damage rolls

**d6** - a six-sided dice, with values ranging from 1-6. Primarily used for damage rolls

**d4** - a four-sided dice, with values ranging from 1 – 4. Primarily used for status damage and determining length of effect

**d100** - Two ten-sided die, with results combined, values from 1 – 100. Primarily used for Fate of the Waygate and Magical Mayhem rolls

The above dice will be prefixed with a number. This number indicates how many of those results you must roll to get your total result.
1d20, means roll 1 twenty-sided die.
3d6, means roll 3 six-sided dice.

<div style="text-align: center;"><ins><h1>Roleplaying</h1></ins></div>

Enter the Waygate is first and foremost a roleplaying game. Your characters are more than just pieces on a board. They should have personalities, strengths and weaknesses, histories, desires, etc. And these details should influence how you play your character: how you think through problems, how you handle complications, how to form your alliances and frienships.

It's not all dicerolls. If you roleplay well, you may find tasks easier or harder to complete. And in the end you will be more immersed in the world around you.

Roleplaying serves another function. While characters can get stronger and gain new skills by leveling up, such advancements can also be the reward for exceptional roleplaying, deep immersion, and smart problem-solving.

<div style="text-align: center;"><ins><h1>Classless</h1></ins></div>

Enter the Waygate is a classless system. This means that there are no pre-defined limitations to what abilities your character could possess. While some skills have prerequisites to their acquiring, so long as you meet those specifications, your character can learn any skill that appears on the skill list.

While classes can provide structure and a path, the system of Enter the Waygate was designed to provide freedom and the ability for players to evolve their characters as the campaign and the world required.

As such you start as a typical human aiming to travel beyond the Waygates for their own personal reasons with their own goals in mind. Playing your character according to their personal traits will lead to growth, which can open up many exciting opportunities. This will be covered in Chapter 5.

<div style="text-align: center;"><ins><h1>Aether</h1></ins></div>

Aether is the natural force that flows out of the Waygates. It is a strange energy that, despite millenia of study across countless worlds and dimensions, remains a mystery in its workings. So far the only things agreed upon are that the Aether originates from the void between dimensions, the Aether reshapes the worlds and beings it touches for too long into places of danger, and within the Aether-filled void exist powerful creatures attracted to those who harness these energies.

The areas with high Aether contamination are places where magic is especially potent, and the people who bend it to their will may find themselves opening doorways to dangerous phenomenon if they do not tread carefully. Magical Mayhem opens up the world to the influence of the Aether, shaping the immediate area to its will.

The Fate of the Waygate itself is an especially phenomenon that befalls those who travel through the Waygates or tamper too hastily with its powers. The traveler of practitioner is flooded with Aether and is reshaped to its will, for better or worse.

<div style="text-align: center;"><ins><h1>Emissaries</h1></ins></div>

Beings of uncountable species that arrived with the opening of the Waygates to extend a welcome to the humans of earth.

No one has seen them since, in this world or the worlds beyond, and their motives for opening the Waygates to the worlds they visit have remained a mystery.

Some have speculated that they are simply beings of knowledge who wish to expand their understanding of the multiverse by researching travelers from the shadows. Others believe they are altruistic and simply want humans to be a part of the grander works of the universe. The rest believe that they have some nefarious plot in motion and that the Waygates were only the beginning.

<div style="text-align: center;"><ins><h1>The Worlds Beyond</h1></ins></div>

There is no formula to the worlds beyond. Some are primal, savage places. Others are places where peace and tranquility are the rule.

The worlds you travel can be anywhere on the spectrum. Most worlds you face will be those far more brutal than ours, though with a civilization of their own.

They will be filled with creatures; those you are familiar with and those unlike anything you have ever seen before. Some will be hostile, some indifferent, others peaceful. How you interact with them and how they interact with you will depend largely on how you carry yourself through the world and how you choose to interact with those beings you come across on the way.

The Aether has shaped these worlds for far longer than Earth, and their influence is drastically apparent. Magic is prevalent where the Waygates' influence has taken hold, and even those races and species familiar to you will have been reshaped to their will.
